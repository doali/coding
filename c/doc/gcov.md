# gcov

GNU COVerage

```bash
gcov is a test coverage program.  Use it in concert with GCC to analyze your programs to help create more efficient,
       faster running code and to discover untested parts of your program.  You can use gcov as a profiling tool to help discover
       where your optimization efforts will best affect your code.  You can also use gcov along with the other profiling tool,
       gprof, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount of computing time.
```
